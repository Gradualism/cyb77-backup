# Cyberpunk 2077 Backup
Backup Cyberpunk 2077 saves

### Purpose
Takes the current save folder and backs it up (like a quick-save for saves). Names the folder with current date.

Easy to use and does not need to be in the folder (it seeks the current user's home directory and goes from there).
A simple `python cp77backup`, assuming you've got Python 3.5+ installed, will do the thing. 

### Note
This project is in transition towards a GUI. A very simple (and ugly) GUI is available by running the script.
Improvements to be determined as time becomes available!

### Requirements
Works with Python 3.5+.
